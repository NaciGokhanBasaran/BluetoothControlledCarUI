# Arduino Car with Python Tkinter UI

In this project, my friend Utku Decdeli and I developed an Arduino-powered car controlled through a custom-built Python Tkinter GUI. The interface allows real-time control and communication with the robot via serial connection.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Arduino Uno**
- -**ESP32 CAM**
- **L298N Motor Driver**
- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module / USB Serial**
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter**

## 📡 Communication

The car receives movement commands (e.g., forward, backward, turn left/right) from the Python application via serial (or optionally Bluetooth), which are then interpreted by the
